    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>
      When it comes to a comprehensive installation guide, nothing beats the
      <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide">official installation guide.</a>
      However, because it's so comprehensive, it often presents only general guidelines, rather than
      specific recommendations beginners are usually looking for. This guide goes over some specific
      things I learned during my several installations and their advantages/disadvantages.

    <h3>Partitioning</h3>
    <p>
      My current partition layout on a 256 GB SSD is as follows:
      <pre>
        +---------------------------+ +---------------------------+---------------+
        | EFI System Partition      | | Logical volume (root)     | Empty space   |
        | /dev/nvme0n1p1            | | /dev/vg1/root             | for snapshots |
        |                           | |                           |               |
        | Size: 512 MiB             | | Size: 230 GiB             | Size: ~8 GiB  |
        | Type: EFI System          | | Mounted on: /             |               |
        | Mounted on: /boot         | |                           |               |
        |                           | |                           |               |
        |                           | |                           |               |
        |                           | +---------------------------+---------------+
        |                           | |                                           |
        |                           | | LUKS2 encrypted partition                 |
        |                           | | /dev/nvme0n1p2                            |
        |                           | |                                           |
        |                           | | Size: 100% remaining                      |
        |                           | | Type: Linux filesystem                    |
        |                           | | PV: /dev/mapper/cryptlvm                  |
        |                           | |                                           |
        +---------------------------+ +-------------------------------------------+
      </pre>
      I've forgone the usual swap partition because my laptop has 32 GiB of RAM, which has been more
      than enough to handle my daily usage. I don't need hibernation either, so this works fine for
      me. However, after reading
      <a href="https://haydenjames.io/linux-performance-almost-always-add-swap-space/">this article,</a>
      I realized that reserving around 4 GiB of swap space (in exchange for a smaller snapshot
      space, which I never fully utilize anyways), could result in cache performance benefits and
      provide some leeway before processes start getting shut down, should I ever run out of memory
      for any reason. When I upgrade my laptop and get a bigger SSD, I will definitely apply these
      changes.
    </p>
    <h3>Encryption</h3>
    <p>
      As you can see from the diagram under "Partitioning," I have something called a "LUKS2
      encrypted partition." I highly recommend encrypting your hard drive and setting up LVM on top
      of it. This method is known as
      <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#LVM_on_LUKS">LVM on LUKS,</a>
      and it's probably the most sensible approach for a personal laptop with a single drive.
