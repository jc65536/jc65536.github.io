        I watched {parasite} for the first time on September 20 with my friends
        in their dorm. Overall it was an interesting movie. There were
        definitely some scary parts, but I liked how the suspense wasn't due to
        supernatural elements or gore.

        The scene where Mr. Kim stabbed Mr. Park confused me. Objectively
        speaking, that was one of the worst decisions he could've made in that
        moment. Not only did one more person die for no good reason, but his
        actions also destroyed what was left of his family. I brought this up
        at the end of the movie, and was told that it was due to the
        "disrespect" he felt from Mr. Park. That seemed like a weak explanation
        to me. I mean it is plausible that in the heat of the moment, having
        just lost his daughter and seeing Mr. Park's disgusted reaction, Mr.
        Kim could've acted impulsively.
