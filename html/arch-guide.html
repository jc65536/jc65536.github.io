      <p>
        When it comes to a comprehensive installation guide, nothing beats the
        <a href="{inst_guide}">official installation guide.</a> However,
        because it's so comprehensive, it often presents only general
        guidelines, rather than specific recommendations beginners are usually
        looking for. This guide goes over some specific things I learned during
        my several installations and their advantages/disadvantages.

      <h3>Partitioning</h3>

        My current partition layout on a 256 GB SSD is as follows:

        <pre>
+-----------------------+ +-------------------------------+---------------+
| EFI System Partition  | | Logical volume 1              | Empty space   |
| /dev/nvme0n1p1        | | /dev/vg1/root                 | for snapshots |

        I've forgone the usual swap partition because my laptop has 32 GiB of
        RAM, which has been more than enough to handle my daily usage. I don't
        need hibernation either, so this works fine for me. However, after
        reading <a href="{add_swap}">this article,</a> I realized that
        reserving around 4 GiB of swap space (in exchange for some of the
        snapshot space, which I never fully utilize anyways), could result in
        cache performance benefits and provide some leeway before processes get
        shut down, should I ever run out of memory for any reason. When I
        upgrade my laptop and get a bigger SSD, I will definitely apply these
        changes.

      <h3>Encryption</h3>

      <p>
        As you can see from the diagram under "Partitioning," I have something
        called a "LUKS2 encrypted partition." I highly recommend encrypting
        your hard drive and setting up LVM on top of it. This method is known
        as <a href="{lvm_luks}">LVM on LUKS,</a> and it's probably the most
        sensible approach for a personal laptop with a single drive. You'll
        unlock your drive once on boot, and after that you'll have normal
        access to your entire drive.
